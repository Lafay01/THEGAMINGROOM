# THEGAMINGROOM
Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design? The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to develop a web-based version of their already existing Android game "Draw It or Lose It". They wanted the game to work well on many different platforms, such as Windows, Androidm iOS, Linux, etc. and needed to support multiple teams and players. There needed to be a way for all games, teams, and players had unique names and ran a single version of the game at any given time.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? The wording was clear and organized. I researched different operating systems and platforms, considering cost, security, scalability, and compatibilty.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? Using a design document was helpful with keeping the document clear and organzied. The document broke down the concepts and requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? I would work on my evaluations. I would work on providing more in-depth advantages and disadvantages for each platform.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? The client had specific requirements and needs, by following their needs, I was able to ensure that the design was scalable, secure, and accessible across platforms. It is important to consider the user's needs because a well designed system improves usability and over satisfaction.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application? I will break down the components and analyze the needs and requirements thoroughly.
